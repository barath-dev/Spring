Topics Learnt:

1. Dependency Injection
 1.1 Types:
  1.1.1 Constructor Injection
  1.1.2 Setter Injection
  1.1.3 Field Injection


How to link two components:
1. Using Auto Wiring for both setter and Feild 
2. Using Application context and calling the object from the IoC container 
3. Using constructor ijection to call by default 


Under AutoWiring, 
1. When the type of the feild is a interface which has a single implemented 
class then the compiler auto-detects the implemented class and assigns the 
object of the class 
(Prerequisites: The implemented class should be annoated with Component)

2. When the type of the feild is a interface which has more than one implemented
class then either Qualifier annoatation is used to mention the bean name that should be used
else anyone of the implemented components should be annoated with @Primary
